# Artificial Intelligence Resources

Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) is the practice of applying DevOps principles to help automate, manage, and monitor the end-to-end machine learning lifecycle. MLOps enables data scientists and machine learning engineers to work together to increase deployment speed, test new models, and maintain the production environment.
