# Computer Vision

Computer vision is a field of computer science that deals with the understanding of digital images and videos. It is concerned with the development of algorithms that can interpret and process visual information in a way that is similar to how humans do. Computer vision has many applications, including image classification, object detection, image segmentation, and video tracking.
