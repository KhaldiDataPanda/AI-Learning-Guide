# Agentic AI

Agentic AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that can act autonomously to achieve goals, make decisions, and take actions in complex environments. These systems go beyond simple input-output models by demonstrating goal-directed behavior, planning capabilities, and the ability to interact with tools and environments. Agentic AI has applications in autonomous agents, multi-agent systems, tool use, reasoning, and decision-making systems.
