# BioAI

BioAI is a field of artificial intelligence that applies machine learning and deep learning techniques to biological data. BioAI has the potential to revolutionize biomedical research and healthcare by accelerating the discovery of new drugs and treatments, and by improving the diagnosis and prognosis of diseases.
